# Limsamaatti 0.1

Limsamaatti is the frontend-backend half of a larger Limsamaatti-project that also includes the project Limsamaatti-connections. Simple one page application that through a simple to use UI allows users to create/delete a user, give money to the users account, purchase products shown on the page. These actions are also called to the Connections side so both projects should be started to use as a whole.

The application is being made to give a digital avenue for Cluster to track their members soda purchases and allowing the person responsible for the selling to track the purchases
